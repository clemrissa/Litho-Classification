# Volcanic Facies Classification - Random Forest
Handle classification within volcanic formation using Random Forest. Another method is also included to be compared. In this case I'm dealing with Tuff, Igneous Rock (Andesite, Basalt), and Sedimentary sequences (Tuffaceous Sandstone, Shale), and Conglomerates.

It's better to see the documentation in the notebook because the code are not made to run as a whole process.
