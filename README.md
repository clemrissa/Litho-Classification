# Volcanic Facies Classification - Random Forest
Handle classification within volcanic formation using Random Forest. Another method is also included to be compared. In this case I'm dealing with Tuff, Igneous Rock (Andesite, Basalt), and Sedimentary sequences (Tuffaceous Sandstone, Shale), and Conglomerates.

It's better to see the documentation in the notebook first because the code are not made to run as a whole process. I also attached a support to be used in data preparation. The file "Lithology Labelling" can help you to label the data, combine what you see in the LAS file with the lithology from core description, cutting, or mudlog.
